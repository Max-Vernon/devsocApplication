  <h1>Lets get down to business, no more trolling</h1>
  <p>I've never actually used html or css before but I'd love the opportunity to work on a project in a group and learn lots along the way :)</p>
  <p>After only hearing about this trainee program from my brother yesterday then having to work (unpaid) for my father all day today the website is looking pretty slick</p>
  <p>not tooting my own horn or anything</p>
